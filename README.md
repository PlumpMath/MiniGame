# MiniGame

This is a simple game made in panda3d. 
You can move the character (Crash) in the little map with WASD and he will rotate when you change direction, performing a walking animation.
You can throw a ball with Crash pressing "g" and try to hit the objects on the table; this for me was an introduction to collision mechanics.
You can move the camera with arrows.
I made the character model Crash and his animations in Blender (so painful).
